# vaginal-microbiome-and-hpv
Here I describe the analysis of vaginal samples from 36 Kenyan women living with HIV, 18 being positive for high-risk HPV and the other 18 negative. 16S rRNA sequencing of the V3-V4 region was performed to characterise the vaginal microbiomes of the study population. The aim of the project is to identify the bacterial profiles associated with HPV infection in women living with HIV and assess whether there is a statistical significance in alpha and beta diversity between the cases (HPV positive) and controls (HPV negative). Quality control and taxonomic assignment, data visualisation and differential abundance analysis was done using the DADA2, Phyloseq and DESeq2 Bioconductor packages in R 4.4.0, respectively. The sequencing experiment was performed on the MGI DNBSEQ-G99 platform.
